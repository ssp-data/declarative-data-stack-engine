    dds stands for delclarative data stack engine.
    To build using the local population data (./local/pop.csv), run using the 'local' environment: 'sdf run -e local --show all'

    To pull data from s3 (s3://sdfdatasets), first authenticate SDF with a local AWS profile. This can be any AWS profile, as the S3 bucket is public.
    Use: `sdf auth login aws --profile <profile>`

    Next, run using the remote environment: 'sdf run -e remote --show all'. 

    Type 'sdf compile' to view schema information for either environment.
